            <h5 class="center">THE STORY</h5>
            <p class="light">
              I moved to Australia in 1998.<br><br>

              I worked and learned how to say "crikey," and eventually got my citizenship. I stayed in Australia for ten years before moving back to Austin (my hometown) in 2008.<br><br>

              In 2004, I bought the old Falcon in Brisbane, where we lived. This was my first ever muscle car, something I'd wanted desperately since my teenage years.<br><br>

              This car was not an investment project, it was the realization of my lifelong desire to own a badass muscle car.<br><br>

              I knew it needed a lot of work. It was fun to drive as it was, but there were continuing performance and dependability issues with it, and I had the engine and transmission completely rebuilt professionally in 2007.<br><br>

              My wife and I made the decision to move back to the USA in 2008, and I insisted we find a way to ship the old ute with us. The movers literally built a wooden rack around the car so they could fit it in the shipping container and pack furniture and such around it.<br><br>


              Once the car arrived in the USA, I had to go through a great deal of hassle to get it registered and insured, but I got it done. At that time, the registration folks told me this car was one of only two they have on their books for the entire USA.<br><br>

              I NEVER intended to sell this car.<br><br>

              But in 2013, we had our first son, and in 2015 we had our second.<br><br>

              Long story short- we never get to drive the old car anymore and we really need the money. It breaks my heart, but I have decided it's time to let it pass on to someone who can give it the love and attention it needs and deserves.<br><br>

              This car is so much fun to drive.<br><br>

              It turns a lot of heads and you make a lot of friends when you park anywhere in it!<br><br>

              I have a lot of personal attachment to this old car, and I really would like to see it go to a loving home.<br><br>

              If you want to show the car, it needs a lot of cosmetic restoration (some rust, paint, dash, shifter console, carpet, etc), but it is just fine as-is as a daily driver.<br><br>

              The car is insured (liability) and has antique plates and current safety inspection.<br><br>

              <strong>Asking $13,500</strong><br><br>

            <h5 class="center">THE SPECIFICS</h5>
            <p class="light">1970 Aussie Ford XW Falcon Ute<br><br>

              Was customized to look like a 1971 XY Falcon GT that is an iconic Australian muscle car.<br><br>

              Right-hand drive<br><br>

              Windsor 302 V8<br><br>

              C6, 3spd auto transmission, floor shift<br><br>

              Engine and transmission completely rebuilt professionally in 2007. Cylinders rebored, cam was slightly modified, stall converter added, GT racing radiator installed (does not overheat now).<br><br>

              Suspension and tires redone professionally in 2013 by Walker Tire (on North Lamar).<br><br>

              It has a standard Autolite 2bbl carb (I used this car as a daily driver for a long time and never drove it recklessly whatsoever).<br><br>

              I had a decent custom sound system installed. There's not much room, but I did what I could (and what made sense - I didn't modify the car).<br><br>

              No heat (could be restored), never had AC or power steering.<br><br>

              Driver side visor needs to be fixed (I just took it off)<br><br>

              Passenger-side window does not function (has new winding mechanism, but the alignment never worked right and the window kept jamming so I just fixed it shut and removed the cranking handle).<br><br>

              Vent-windows do not stay open (but do open)<br><br>

              Odometer, speedometer, fuel gauge, cigarette lighter do not function.<br><br>

              Hood release cable broke, so I re-engineered it to open from a pull in the front<br><br>

              This car is street legal, no problem to get inspected and runs on regular gas with no additives necessary. It's dependable as a daily driver.<br><br>

              So overall, the ute is mechanically very solid. The drive-train is pretty much new as-of 2007, and suspension and tires were redone in 2013.<br><br>

              I Have: rear bumper (not required, but could be re-attached), black XW 302 pinstripe set, hood pins, vinyl bed tonneau cover<br><br>
